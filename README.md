# odin-calculator
This project was part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Foundations curriculum.
I was instructed to recreate a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JS.

The calculator functions like the calculator found here: https://mrbuddh4.github.io/calculator/, instead of how it regularly works (pressing a number after operator and same operator twice doesn't evaluate current number displayed).
I programmed it this way because I thought that was what the specification was, however after comparing my project to other projects, I guess I programmed it differently.

<p>This project was meant to demonstrate my use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML and CSS design</li>
  <li>Use of Event Listeners</li>
  <li>Use of storing user data</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
</ul>

## Objectives
<ol>
  <li>Create 4 functions, add, subtract, multiply, and divide.</li>
  <li>Create a basic calculator using HTML</li>
  <li>Create function(s) to populate the display of the calculator</li>
  <li>Create function(s) to calculate user inputted numbers</li>
  <li>Fix any bugs that pop up during creation of calculator</li>
</ol>
